Fueling his passion for programming, you can now find Ryan tinkering with his computer, tackling any problem that comes about.<br><br>Even off the clock, Ryan is an industrious developer, designing websites that benefit large gaming communities.

                    <p>Growing up, Ryan always had two role models who shaped him into the person he is today. His older brother was more than just a sibling; he was the guy Ryan looked up to, the one who filled their home with laughter, love, and fun. He could beatbox like a pro and turn any moment into a reason to laugh. Ryan admired his confidence. He wanted to be just like him; someone who could walk into any room, own it with humor, and make everyone feel at ease and good about themselves.<br><br>A source of infinite inspiration, Ryan’s mother is the no-nonsense type of woman who made things happen. She brought them to America with a dream, saving and working tirelessly to build the life she always envisioned. She wasn’t just raising her children; she was laying down the foundation for their future. And now, with her hard-earned money, she has been building a home in Antigua, the place where she grew up, the place she will soon be retiring to in her lovely new beautiful home in heaven-sent Antigua. Ryan has an overwhelming sense of pride when he thinks about his mother, knowing how much she had fought for their family, and how he wants to be just as diligent and driven as her.</p>

                    <p>Leaving a cheerful impression on this world is important to Ryan. He wants his legacy to be that of laughter and smiles. He aspires to be the positive force that lightens the lives of those around him. He hopes that it is his lighthearted humor and the good times he brings is what he is remembered for.<br><br>Ryan looks forward to the day that he is someone that others can look up to, as he knows how grateful he is to the people in his life that helped mold him into the confident person he is today just by being themselves. He hopes to inspire others the same way, changing the lives around him for the better even with just a smile or two.<br><br>As Ryan states, “take things less seriously, look forward, and laugh a little.”</p>

                    <p>Ryan is a man with a plan. He has meticulously planned his goals of achieving financial freedom and independence by transitioning from a QA engineer to a back-end developer within two years, wrangling primarily with APIs. Aside from programming, Ryan has his eyes set on securing a shiny new apartment of his own by next year, rolling up with a brand new car, and becoming completely self-sufficient.<br><br>As an avid gym-bro, Ryan plans to make it to his goal weight of 200 lbs to get shredded, so that he can open any jar on the planet with ease (it’s all about jar-dominance, baby). And just when you thought he couldn’t get more impressive, he’s set his sights on learning how to cornrow his hair, because why not look fresh while you’re grinding coding problems and throwing down protein shakes?</p>

                    <p>Ryan finds himself drawn to those that carry a light in their eyes; a spark that defies the weight of the world. The elderly in particular that possess this quality fascinates him, as they carry a radiance of joy and passion even in their harshest of years. Their resilience to society’s norms of bitterness and cynicism is something he deeply admires.<br><br>He knows how much you’ll miss out on life if you keep your head down and keep worrying about what other people think. He hopes to embody that same level of warmth and sense of humor when his time comes, sharing his light with everyone that crosses his path.<br><br>"I'm living with every step. I can't live with regret. The past is the past. I'm not worried about it. I can't change it. I can't fix it. It is what it is. I'm just living."-Ryan Sheckler</p>

Speaking of famous people, known as a bowling legend, Ryan strikes the perfect score on and off the lanes. One of those perfect scores being his dishes, cooking a mean curry, West Indian style, his specialties being curry chicken, brown stew chicken, cabbage, and tasty mac n cheese.<br><br>Lucky for Ryan, all this food translates to incredible gains towards his goal, hitting the gym on a regular basis, pumping protein and creatine through his veins. With a good workout, one always needs a rest day. As a man of culture, Ryan has no shame admitting how much he cherishes his sleep, recognizing just how precious it is especially in adulthood. Winding down and taking time to breathe, and not take life so seriously is crucial to a good headspace for him. </p>
